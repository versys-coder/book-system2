The best way in the world to make a website. Start from blank, and build any design you want.

== Description ==

<h4>SUPER BLANK MAKES IT SUPER EASY TO BUILD YOUR WEBSITE</h4>

<p>With just one click it lets you install a beautiful, clean, and fully responsive blank layout.</p>

<p>This gives you the perfect starting point, and then you can use Elementor to build anything that you want from there.</p>

<p>No more choosing a theme, staring at a confusing screen, or fighting with complicated settings.</p>

<p>Super Blank makes website building super easy – even if you've never built a website before.</p>

<p>Just follow these simple steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Click a button to import your blank design.</li>
	<li>Preview and choose your favorite colors that automatically apply to your whole site.</li>
	<li>Choose from our hundreds of ready-made design options to customize your site's layout.</li>
	<li>Add your own images, text, and content to make it yours.</li>
	<li>And that's it, you've got a beautiful modern website!</li>
</ol>

<p>To make this possible, Super Blank uses the Astra theme together with the Elementor editor.</p>

<p>Astra is one of the most popular themes on WordPress, and Elementor is the most popular page builder.</p>

<p>Super Blank brings them together, allowing you to make your dream design super easy and super fast.</p>

<p>Want to change the look and feel of your whole site? Just change the global colors and fonts in a single place within Astra, and your whole design will adapt.</p>

<p>Want to mix things up? Super Blank lets you combine different layouts to create exactly what you need, right inside the Elementor editor.</p>

<p>You can easily swap sections, move things around, and make the design your own. Even if you're a complete beginner.</p>

<p>With Super Blank, you can have a beautiful website up and running in no time.</p>
